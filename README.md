This project simulates the operation of real-world traffic lights using an Arduino microcontroller. It employs LEDs to represent red, yellow, and green lights, cycling through them in sequence to mimic traffic flow control. The code manages the timing of each light transition using a simple timer logic. This project serves as an excellent introduction to traffic management systems and Arduino programming.
